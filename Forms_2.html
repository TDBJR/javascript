<!-- Javascript automatically creates all forms as a forms[] array/list. 
The first form is forms[0] the second forms[1] the third forms[2] 
Forms is a child of document so when you call it you need to write document.forms[]
An Array is also created for the elements in a Forms[] object as document.forms[].elements[]
but you can also access a form and it's elements by its name 
document.tommysFantasticForm.username -->
